# Welcome to the USDRCG wiki!

**This is where we keep all of the documentation for you to use as you learn how to use USD's HPC.**

**Select topics from the navigation section on the left.**

**You'll find information for **[**New User Training**](https://github.com/USDRCG/usdrcg.github.io/wiki/New-User-Training)** that guides you through interacting with the HPC.**

**Also, we have how-to documentation for popular software and applications. More content is added periodically.**

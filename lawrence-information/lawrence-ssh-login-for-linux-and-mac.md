# Lawrence SSH Login for Linux and Mac

To start you will need to open a terminal or command line interface.

Next, you will need to login via an ssh session through the login node. You must be given access by the HPC administrator \(which can be requested by contacting the HelpDesk\). Login as so:

```
[user@localhost ~]$
[user@localhost ~]$ ssh User.Name@lawrence.usd.edu
```

You will then be prompted for a password. Enter you regular USD credentials. \(Note: the password you type will not show up on the screen.\) If you have more than five failed attempts at logging in you will be locked out for one hour or until access is reinstated by the system administrator.

```
User.Name@hpc.usd.edu's password:
```

The password you type will not show up on the screen. Once logged in successfully, all users should get their last login and a command line prompt:

```
Last login: (date and address here)
[user.name@usd.local@login ~]$
```

# Scratch Directory Use

Slurm creates /scratch/$SLURM\_JOB\_ID when your job is running. If you want to modify or use this output, you could include something like this in your job script:

`SCRATCH="/scratch/$SLURM_JOB_ID"`

`cp $HOME/workfile.txt $SCRATCH`

`cd $SCRATCH`

`# run dommands, do things`

`cp resultfile.txt $HOME`

# Slurm

The Slurm Workload Manager is the job scheduler used by the Lawrence HPC. For a comprehensive overview of Slurm commands, visit the slurm webpage:[https://slurm.schedmd.com/quickstart.html](https://slurm.schedmd.com/quickstart.html)

For the commonly used Slurm commands on the Lawrence HPC, we have provided quick-start documentation with examples within the Wiki.

# Interactive Jobs

##### General Compute

Interactive sessions on compute nodes can be used with the Slurm command "srun". For the use of one node, this command can be used generally as demonstrated below:

```
[user.name@usd.local@login ~]$ srun --pty bash
[user.name@usd.local@node37 ~]$
```

##### HiMem

The Lawrence high-memory \(himem\) partition has two nodes, each with 1.5 TB of RAM. This node is especially useful for jobs requiring a large amount of memory and can be accessed either interactively or with a batch script.

For interactive jobs on the Lawrence himem nodes, use the srun command as follows:

```
[user.name@usd.local@login ~]$ srun --pty -p himem bash
[user.name@usd.local@himem02 ~]$
```

##### GPU

For interactive GPU sessions, the gpu node is requested as below:

```
[user.name@usd.local@login ~]$ srun --pty -p gpu --gres=gpu:pascal:1 bash
[user.name@usd.local@gpu01 ~]$
```

# Batch Jobs

##### General Compute

Batch jobs can be submitted on the Lawrence cluster using Slurm commands. A variety of configurations can be used for formulating a batch script. A basic batch script will look like the one below:

```
#!/bin/bash

#SBATCH -N 10
#SBATCH -q regular
#SBATCH -J example1
#SBATCH --mail-user=user.name@coyotes.usd.edu
#SBATCH --mail-type=ALL
#SBATCH -t 12:00:00

#OpenMP settings:
export OMP_NUM_THREADS=1
export OMP_PLACES=threads
export OMP_PROC_BIND=spread

#run the application after this line##########################
srun -n 10 -c 48 --cpu_bind=cores /share/apps/someapp
```

##### HiMem

To use a high memory node within a batch job, add “--partition=himem” to your script.

Below is an example batch script which calls the a high-memory node. This template can be followed when requesting the himem node on Lawrence:

```
#!/bin/bash

# Example job submission script
# This is a comment.
# Lines beginning with the # symbol are comments and are not interpreted by
# the Job Scheduler.
# Lines beginning with #SBATCH are special commands to configure the job.

### Job Configuration Starts Here #############################################
# Export all current environment variables to the job (Don't change this)
#SBATCH --get-user-env
# The default is one task per node
#SBATCH --ntasks=1
#SBATCH --nodes=1
# Request a high memory node
#SBATCH --partition=himem
# Request all memory on the node
#SBATCH --mem=0
#request 10 minutes of runtime - the job will be killed if it exceeds this
#SBATCH --time=10:00
# Change email@example.com to your real email address
#SBATCH --mail-user=email@example.com
#SBATCH --mail-type=ALL

### Commands to run your program start here ####################################
pwd
echo "Hello, World!"
sleep 5
```

##### GPU

Below is an example batch script which calls the GPU node, this template can be followed when requesting a GPU node on Lawrence:

```
#!/bin/bash

# template.slurm: Example job submission script
# This is a comment.
# Lines beginning with the # symbol are comments and are not interpreted by
# the Job Scheduler.
# Lines beginning with #SBATCH are special commands to configure the job.

### Job Configuration Starts Here #############################################
# Export all current environment variables to the job (Don't change this)
#SBATCH --get-user-env
# The default is one task per node
#SBATCH --ntasks=1
#SBATCH --nodes=1
# Request 1 GPU
# Each gpu node has two logical GPUs, so up to 2 can be requested per node
# To request 2 GPUs use --gres=gpu:pascal:2
#SBATCH --partition=gpu
#SBATCH --gres=gpu:pascal:1
#request 10 minutes of runtime - the job will be killed if it exceeds this
#SBATCH --time=10:00
# Change email@example.com to your real email address
#SBATCH --mail-user=email@example.com
#SBATCH --mail-type=ALL

### Commands to run your program start here ####################################
pwd
echo "Hello, World!"
sleep 5

====================================================

Your VNC server is now running!
To connect:
1) Mac/Linux/MobaXterm users: run the following command FROM A NEW LOCAL TERMINAL WINDOW (not this one)
ssh -L50041:localhost:50041 user.name@usd.local@lawrence.usd.edu
For other users (PuTTY, etc) create a new SSH session and tunnel port 50041 to localhost:50041

2) Then from your computer use a vnc client like TigerVNC Viewer to connect to localhost:50041
You can download TigerVNC Viewer from https://bintray.com/tigervnc/stable/tigervnc

##### General Compute

##### HiMem

##### GPU

The GPU node must be specifically requested using the “--gres” parameter. GPU access is controlled by cgroups, which means the resource must be requested if it is to be used. This prevents use conflicts. The format for requesting the GPU node \(as specified in the contig file\) is TYPE:LABEL:NUMBER.

TYPE will be “gpu”.

LABEL is defined as “pascal” for the GPU node.

NUMBER is the amount of resources requested. For the GPU node, there are two logic units, so a user can request “1” or “2”.

An example command would be as follows:

```
srun --pty -p gpu --gres=gpu:pascal:1 bash
```

To see which GPUs are available use the following command:

```
nvidia-smi
```

##### Viz

The Lawrence viz node is designed for users who wish to do advanced visualization. The viz node gives users access to accelerated 3D graphics \(one node with one GPU having a GTX logic unit\). A typical use case for the viz node is a virtual network computing \(VNC\) job coupled with a real-time graphical user interface \(GUI\). Please note that a graphical job can be run on any node on the cluster and is not solely limited to the viz node \(although the viz node will often have the best performance\).

Viz nodes must be specifically requested using the “--gres” parameter. Viz access is controlled by cgroups, which means the resource must be requested if it is to be used. This prevents use conflicts. The format for requesting the GPU node \(as specified in the contig file\) is TYPE:LABEL:NUMBER.

TYPE will be “vis”.

LABEL is defined as “gtx” for the viz node.

NUMBER is the amount of resources requested. For the Vis node the only option is “1” as there is only one.
